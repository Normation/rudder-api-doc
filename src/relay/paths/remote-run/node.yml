  summary: Trigger agent run on a remote node
  description: "Trigger the agent on a managed node (if port `5309` is open to the node). **WARNING**: When running the agent, the `/tmp` folder may not be the global one but a private one, specific to the relay service. You should not rely on `/tmp` content in your policies but use `/var/rudder/tmp` instead."
